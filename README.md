## Auto In Agda

#### Abstract

> We present the reader with an implementation of Prolog-style proof search in Agda.
> We then use this implementation, together with Agdaâ€™s Reflection mechanism,
> to implement an auto tactic for first- order Agda terms.
> Last, we demonstrate one possible usage of this tactic,
> by implementing modular instance search for Agda-style type classes.
